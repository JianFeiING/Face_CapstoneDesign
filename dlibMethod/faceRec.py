        # explain a little, the 3rd argument tells the code how many times to
        # jitter/resample the image.  When you set it to 100 it executes the
        # face descriptor extraction 100 times on slightly modified versions of
        # the face and returns the average result.  You could also pick a more
        # middle value, such as 10, which is only 10x slower but still gets an
        # LFW accuracy of 99.3%.
